1. Compilation phase:
- The code is compiled and checked for errors.
- Static variables (int static_var = 5;) and static arrays are allocated.
- No simulation starts yet!

ðŸ”¹ Code Example:
  int static_var = 5;  // Allocated during compilation & elaboration
  int dynamic_arr[];   // Declared but NOT allocated yet

2.Elaboration Phase (Simplified Explanation):
- Sets up the structure of the design before simulation starts.
- Determines how different parts of the code are connected (e.g., which variables are linked to which assignments).
- Variables are prepared, connections are set, but nothing executes yet.
- Static variables and arrays get their memory.
- Dynamic arrays, queues, and associative arrays are only declared but NOT allocated memory yet


3. Simulation Phases
- Once elaboration is complete, simulation begins at time 0 and follows these execution steps:
- Time starts, delays, assignments everything that is time oriented 

* Simulation ends when $finish is called


REAL LIFE EXAMPLE:
1. Compilation Phase â†’ Checking the Recipe
You check if you have the ingredients (coffee, water, sugar, milk).
Ensure the coffee machine is working.
If something is missing (syntax error), you stop before starting.

2. Elaboration Phase â†’ Setting Up the Coffee Machine
You connect the machine, put coffee in the filter, and pour water.
You havenâ€™t started brewing yet, but everything is set up and ready.

3. Simulation Phases â†’ Making & Drinking Coffee
Now the real action starts!

Time 0 Phase â†’ Turning the Machine On
You press the power button, and the machine starts working.
Water is already in the machine (static variables initialized).
Active Region (Water Starts Dripping)
You donâ€™t get coffee until the whole process is done.
Postponed Region (Cleaning the Machine)

4. End of Simulation â†’ Finishing the Coffee
The coffee is done, the machine turns off.
